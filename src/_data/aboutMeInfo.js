  <p>I'm a full-stack developer from New York City, born in Brooklyn and living in the Bronx.</p>
  <p>I love building useful apps that are hopefully delightful. Almost everything I've built with code so far had a real purpose for me. I've built apps for my classes when I worked as a music teacher and for getting a feeding schedule for my new pet lizard going. I felt that this was the best way for me to learn how to code; building simple CRUD apps, todo lists, and Javascript calculators just wasn't cutting it for me.</p>
  <p>Coding is a tool. Like learning music or a martial art, where your instrument and your body are merely tools, you only achieve progress if you are consistent, open to new ways, and approach the work with a higher purpose.</p>
  <p>When I'm not building (or learning about building) software, I enjoy...</p>
  <p>ðŸŽ¹ <i>Music:</i> I've been playing music since I was a teen, mainly piano, synths, and messing around with Logic Pro. I like making electronic music that sounds like prog rock/metal. Learning Sonic Pi now that I can code. Check out my Soundcloud link in the navbar below to listen to my work!</p>
  <p>ðŸ¥˜ <i>Cooking:</i> Italian, Arab, Asian, burgers, vegan, you name it. My signature dish is chocolate peanut butter bars topped with marshmallows and flavored with cinnamon.</p>
  <p>ðŸª´ <i>Gardening:</i> My fiancee and I grew a jungle in our apartment during lockdown. One of my goals is to create an app that tells me when to water my plants.</p>
  <p>ðŸ¥‹ <i>Martial arts:</i> I did tae kwon do in my teens and karate in my 20s. I switched to kung fu for my 30s because I stopped enjoying the competitiveness of karate.</p>
  <p>ðŸŽ® <i>Video games:</i> Just got a Nintendo Switch recently and I'm on a huge nostalgia kick right now. Currently addicted to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Pokemon.</p>
  <p>ðŸ“ˆ <i>Playing the stock market:</i> My fiancee and I recently started our journey to better financial literacy. I bought a few shares recently and I'm just sitting on them now.</p>
