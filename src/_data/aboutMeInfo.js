  <p>I'm a full-stack developer from New York City, born in Brooklyn and living in the Bronx.</p>
  <p>I love building useful apps that are hopefully delightful. Almost everything I've built with code so far had a real purpose for me. I've built apps for my classes when I worked as a music teacher and for getting a feeding schedule for my new pet lizard going. I felt that this was the best way for me to learn how to code; building simple CRUD apps, todo lists, and Javascript calculators just wasn't cutting it for me.</p>
  <p>Coding is a tool. Like learning music or a martial art, where your instrument and your body are merely tools, you only achieve progress if you are consistent, open to new ways, and approach the work with a higher purpose.</p>
  <p>When I'm not building (or learning about building) software, I enjoy...</p>
  <p>üéπ <i>Music:</i> I've been playing music since I was a teen, mainly piano, synths, and messing around with Logic Pro. I like making electronic music that sounds like prog rock/metal. Learning Sonic Pi now that I can code. Check out my Soundcloud link in the navbar below to listen to my work!</p>
  <p>ü•ò <i>Cooking:</i> Italian, Arab, Asian, burgers, vegan, you name it. My signature dish is chocolate peanut butter bars topped with marshmallows and flavored with cinnamon.</p>
  <p>ü™¥ <i>Gardening:</i> My fiancee and I grew a jungle in our apartment during lockdown. One of my goals is to create an app that tells me when to water my plants.</p>
  <p>ü•ã <i>Martial arts:</i> I did tae kwon do in my teens and karate in my 20s. I switched to kung fu for my 30s because I stopped enjoying the competitiveness of karate.</p>
  <p>üéÆ <i>Video games:</i> Just got a Nintendo Switch recently and I'm on a huge nostalgia kick right now. Currently addicted to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Pokemon.</p>
  <p>üìà <i>Playing the stock market:</i> My fiancee and I recently started our journey to better financial literacy. I bought a few shares recently and I'm just sitting on them now.</p>

// Sections of About Me (WIP)
// Developer
  // I've been coding in Javascript and Python on and off since 2019 when I started thinking about making apps for my then-career as a music teacher. Then I enrolled in Springboard's software engineering bootcamp in 2021 and studied while I worked. This led to me toying around with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make apps that aid in my instruction. Right now, I'm looking for my first dev job, taking on freelance work, maintaining a support group for junior devs, and helping another developer create a pair programming platform.
// Educator-Developer
  // I taught for 4 years, 3 of them as a music teacher at an elementary school for autistic students, and hold a Masters in special education. I specialized in the intersection of art, technology, and neurodiversity, and while I loved it, professional growth for teachers is limited. I used code to solve common problems I faced teaching autistic students by designing neurodivergent-friendly UI, which is what special education basically is, and using web technologies to create multisensory learning experiences. I don't teach anymore and don't plan to anytime soon but it'll forever be part of my identity.
// Musician
  // I've been playing music since I was a teenager. I learned jazz piano and eventually moved on to playing around with synthesizers and music production. I've played in a few bands but I love making electronic music that sounds like prog rock/metal. Think of the sprawling soundscapes and epicness of Pink Floyd mixed with Aphex Twin's setup and video game sensibility. I haven't made new music in a while since teaching took up a lot of time but I recently restructured my routine to include it.
// Personal
  // I'm originally from New York City. Born and raised in Brooklyn and now living in the Bronx with my fiancee, Melody (we worked on this for a hackathon together), and our pets, üêà Milo and ü¶é Unity (I made this when I was learning what Unity eats). I'm also on the autism spectrum, which probably explains my interest in neurodiversity.
  // Other than programming and music, I love...
  // ü•ò <i>Cooking:</i> Italian, Arab, Asian, burgers, vegetarian, you name it. I'm one of those people who actually love cooking for guests. My signature is chocolate peanut butter bars topped with marshmallows and flavored with cinnamon.
  // ü™¥ <i>Gardening:</i> My fiancee and I grew a jungle in our apartment during lockdown. One of my goals is to create an app that tells me when to water our plants.
  // ü•ã <i>Martial arts:</i> I did tae kwon do in my teens and hold a black belt in karate. I switched to kung fu because I recently stopped enjoying the competitiveness of karate.
  // üéÆ <i>Video games:</i> Just got a Nintendo Switch recently and the first games I bought are nostalgic... Currently addicted to Pokemon.
